<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Maqbool</h3>
<p>Outstanding,versatile actor Irfan khan played many distinguished roles.whether they were in movies or serials.None can fill up his place.
    Maqbool, Haidar,Pan Singh Tomar are the most memorable movies for mine. I have watched most of the movies of him.
    William Shakespeare is one of my favorite authors.<br /> I'm a beloved fan of "Macbeth".
    Maqbool is an outstanding crime drama film by Vishal Bhardwaj. Based on Macbeth by William Shakespeare.
    The film is greatly directed by Vishal Bhardwaj and written by Vishal Bhardwaj.
    
    Irrfan Khan outstandingly played the main role with Tabu, Pakaj Kapur, Om Puri,  Naseeruddiin
    Shah.All brilliantly played their roles.
    Miss you Irfan khan.
    RIP💐💐💐💐</p>
<h3>A Wednes Day</h3>
<p>Great Movie, Good thriller and always maintains the intensity. 
    There is no part in the movie which gets you bored. Its full time Entertainment.
    The movie is short but up to the point. This is a movie where Naseerudin Shah is like a One Man Army who takes over the whole of Bombay police. I really enjoyed it. We need more movies like this. 
    Very Creative.</p>
<h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
<p>Tom Hanks and leonardo dicaprio is a great combo.
        It contains everything a movies should have. Must watch
