<h1>Summary</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
As a Business Analyst at Odessa, I engage with clients to gather business requirements and translate them into functional specifications, user stories, workflow, or process diagrams. I also create end-to-end testing scenarios to validate the functionality of the system and provide functional support to different stakeholders.</p>
<p> I have over two years of experience in core banking and leasing projects, where I have contributed to project planning, defect analysis and solutioning, client management, stakeholder management, and post go-live support. I have used SQL to manage data in databases, prepare reports, and make business decisions. I possess a good working knowledge of Agile methodology, which I have applied in sprint and release planning activities.</p>
<P>I hold a PGDM in Operation Management and Business Analytics from KIAMS, where I learned how to optimize the available resources, reduce the cycle time of the process, and implement KAIZEN at workstations. I also have a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University. </P>
<p>My goal is to leverage my analytical, technical, and communication skills to deliver value-added solutions to Odessa and its clients. I am motivated by challenging and complex problems that require creativity and collaboration. I am passionate about learning new technologies and tools that can enhance my productivity and performance.</p>
